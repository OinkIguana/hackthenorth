# Song Sonar

Ever seen someone on the street and wondered what music they were listening to
but didn't want to go talk to them because social interaction is just so not
cool anymore? Wonder no more with Song Sonar!

Song Sonar tells you what songs people are listening to nearby without giving
away your location! This way you can stay anonymous, but still interact with
other people around you. It's antisocial interaction, and this is an antisocial
network.

Created for Hack the North 2017, this two day hack is more of a proof of concept
than anything. We do hope to continue working on it in the future, adding these
exciting features:

-   Recommendations:
    -   Send people song recommendations, whether you know them or not. If they
        like your suggestions you might even be rewarded somehow. Or maybe not.
        It's worth a shot though!
-   Keep track of others:
    -   Follow friends and strangers alike and see what music they like. A
        great way to find people with similar interests, or at least songs that
        similar people like.
-   Share your music:
    -   Why share your headphones with your friends when you can just both
        listen to the same song at the same time? We'll even sync up your
        playlists. You can even do it with strangers now---antisocial
        interaction at its finest.
